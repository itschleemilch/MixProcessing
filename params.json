The user defines output channels, which are free ediable areas on a output devices and can be grouped. The sketches can be controlled to render to any of the channels. A mixer let you control your compsition. Later there is a common interface for sketches planned, to set parameters (colors, speed, etc.) in real-time.\r\n\r\nThe technique of output channels can be used to create [mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_mapping) ([example 1](http://www.vjseptum.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Coliseum_VO_003.jpg)).\r\n\r\n##Licence\r\nThis software is free software. The following licences are applied:\r\n* Source Code, Documentation: [GPL Version 3](https://github.com/itschleemilch/MixProcessing/raw/master/LICENSE)\r\n* Media Files: [Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/de/deed.en)\r\n\r\n###Features\r\n* Loading of compiled Processing Sketches\r\n* Rendering to editable output areas (channels)\r\n* Grouping channels\r\n* Scripting Interface to control the composition\r\n* (planned) Loading Processing Projects and Compiling them\r\n* (planned) User Interface for Controlling the sketches and the channels\r\n* (planned) Automation of Sketch's Variables\r\n* (planned) Open Sound Control Interaction\r\n\r\nThe current version loades all sketches from a folder and renders them into editable output channels. The channels can be edited by double-clicking and clicking inside the output frame while beeing in the editor-mode. The skripting interface with its menus help to control the software. The graphical mixer isn't finished, yet.\r\n\r\n![Demonstration of the current codebase](https://github.com/itschleemilch/MixProcessing/raw/master/images/2014-08-15_tech_demo2_output.jpg)  \r\nView of the output (e.g. a projector)\r\n\r\n![Edit mode](https://github.com/itschleemilch/MixProcessing/raw/master/images/2014-08-15_tech_demo2.jpg)  \r\nWorkspace to edit the channels and configure the composition with skripting.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nCurrently there are no binary packages. There is a netbeans project file that will do the job. \r\n###Requirements\r\n* Java 1.7 or higher\r\n* Processing core library\r\n\r\n##Help\r\n* [MixProcessing Wiki](https://github.com/itschleemilch/MixProcessing/wiki)\r\n* E-Mail: <github@it-schleemilch.de>\r\n\r\n##Contribution\r\nYou are interested in contributing to MixProject?
