{"name":"MixProcessing","tagline":"Mixing Processing Sketches","body":"#![MixProcessing Logo](https://github.com/itschleemilch/MixProcessing/raw/master/images/MixProcessing-Logo_48x48.png) MixProcessing\r\n\r\nMixProcessing is a software for mixing Processing sketches.\r\n\r\n##What is MixProcessing?\r\n>MixProcessing can be used to combine and mix Processing sketches to create new real-time animations. The output screen is subdivided into output channels, which are free ediable areas. The sketches can be controlled to render to any of the channels or a group af them. A mixer let you control your compsition. An automation interface can set sketch's parameters and public variables automatically.\r\n\r\nPossible Applications:\r\n* [Mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_mapping) ([example 1](http://www.vjseptum.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Coliseum_VO_003.jpg)).\r\n* VJing ((examples)[http://www.vjstv.com/home/]).\r\n* Arty projection installations.\r\n* Interactive story telling using sensors and costum user interfaces.\r\n\r\n##Licence\r\nThis software is free software.

There is a netbeans project file that will do the job. We are working on a Web Start distribution, please be patient.\r\n\r\n###Requirements\r\n* Java 1.7+\r\n* Processing core library\r\n\r\n##Help and Contact\r\n* [MixProcessing Wiki](https://github.com/itschleemilch/MixProcessing/wiki)\r\n* [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/itschleemilch/MixProcessing/issues)\r\n* [User Manual](documentation/user/user_manual.md)\r\n\r\n* E-Mail: <mixprocessing@it-schleemilch.de>\r\n* Twitter: [Follow @mixprocessing](https://twitter.com/mixprocessing), [Tweet to @mixprocessing](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=mixprocessing)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Contribution\r\nYou are interested in contributing to MixProject?
