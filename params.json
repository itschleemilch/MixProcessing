The user defines output channels, which are free ediable areas on a output devices. The sketches can be controlled to render to any of the devices. A mixer let you control the output. Later there is a common interface for sketches planned, to set parameters (colors, speed, etc.) within MixProcessing live.\r\n\r\nThe technique of output channels also can be used to create [mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_mapping) ([example 1](http://www.vjseptum.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Coliseum_VO_003.jpg)).\r\n\r\nMixProcessing handels compiled Processing sketches, they have to be exported.\r\n\r\n##Dependencies\r\nThe project needs the Processing core library.\r\n\r\n##Status\r\n* Loading of compiled Processing Sketches\r\n* Drawing of new output areas (channels)\r\n* Several controls over the sketches and the channels\r\n* Scripting Interface to control the setup\r\n\r\nThe current tech demo loades all sketches from a subfolder and renders them into editable output channels. The channels can be edited by double-clicking and clicking inside the output frame while beeing in the editor-mode. The mixer isn't finished, yet. The skripting interface and the menus help to control the software.\r\n\r\n![Demonstration of the current codebase](https://github.com/itschleemilch/MixProcessing/raw/master/images/2014-08-15_tech_demo2_output.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Edit mode](https://github.com/itschleemilch/MixProcessing/raw/master/images/2014-08-15_tech_demo2.jpg)\r\n\r\n##Known Issues\r\n* Only supports Java2D mode (P2D, P3D will not work)\r\n* The size() function must not be called from the sketch - please remove it before exporting the sketch.\r\n\r\n##Roadmap\r\n* Building a mixer interface\r\n* Define software interface for sketch-settings\r\n* Building an interface for editing sketch-settings\r\n* Building an automation for editing the sketch-settings\r\n\r\n---\r\n[Project Page](http://itschleemilch.github.io/MixProcessing/) * [Processing](http://www.processing.org/) * Thanks to [generative-gestaltung.de](http://generative-gestaltung.de/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
