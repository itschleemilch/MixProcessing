The user defines output channels, which are free ediable areas on a output devices. The sketches can be controlled to render to any of the devices. A mixer let you control the output. Later there is a common interface for sketches planned, to set parameters (colors, speed, etc.) within MixProcessing live.\r\n\r\nThe technique of output channels also can be used to create [mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_mapping) ([example 1](http://www.vjseptum.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Coliseum_VO_003.jpg)).\r\n\r\nMixProcessing handels compiled Processing sketches, they have to be exported.\r\n\r\n##Dependencies\r\nThe project needs the Processing core library.\r\n\r\n##Status\r\nCurrently there is a tech demo, that loades all sketches from a subfolder and renders them into three fixed output areas. \r\n\r\n![Demonstration of the current codebase](https://github.com/itschleemilch/MixProcessing/raw/master/images/2014-08-14_tech_demo.jpg)\r\n\r\n##Known Issues\r\n* Only supports Java2D mode (P2D, P3D will not work)\r\n* The size() function must not be called from the sketch - please remove it before exporting the sketch.\r\n\r\n##Roadmap\r\n* Building an interface for editing the channels\r\n* Building a mixer interface\r\n* Define software interface for sketch-settings\r\n* Build interface for editing sketch-settings\r\n\r\n---\r\n[Project Page](http://itschleemilch.github.io/MixProcessing/) * [Processing](http://www.processing.org/) * Thanks to [generative-gestaltung.de](http://generative-gestaltung.de/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
