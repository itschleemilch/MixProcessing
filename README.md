MixProcessing is a software for mixing Processing sketches.

##What is MixProcessing?
>MixProcessing can be used to combine and mix Processing sketches to create new real-time animations. The output screen is subdivided into output channels, which are free ediable areas. The sketches can be controlled to render to any of the channels or a group af them. A mixer let you control your compsition. An automation interface can set sketch's parameters and public variables automatically.

Possible Applications:
* [Mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_mapping) ([example 1](http://www.vjseptum.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Coliseum_VO_003.jpg)).
* VJing ((examples)[http://www.vjstv.com/home/]).
* Arty projection installations.
* Interactive story telling using sensors and costum user interfaces.
